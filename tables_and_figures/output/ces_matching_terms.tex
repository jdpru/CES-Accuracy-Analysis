\toprule
\textbf{Term} & \textbf{Definition} \\
\midrule
\textbf{Population of Interest} & All U.S. citizens aged 18 and older. The population about which the CES seeks to draw conclusions. \\[8pt]
\textbf{Target Sample} & A stratified random sample drawn from the ACS. Serves as the hypothetical probability sample that the matched sample attempts to replicate. Exists only as records, not CES respondents. \\[8pt]
\textbf{Panel Reservoir} & The full set of panelists from YouGov and partner providers who have agreed to take surveys. A large, nonprobability pool from which respondents may be recruited. \\[8pt]
\textbf{Invited Respondents} & Panelists selected for invitation to the pre-election questionnaire, typically chosen using a cross-classification on demographic variables. Not all invited panelists respond. \\[8pt]
\textbf{Participating Respondents} & Panelists who complete the pre-election (and, when applicable, post-election) questionnaire. These are the realized respondents from whom matches can be drawn. \\[8pt]
\textbf{Matched Sample} & The subset of participating respondents whose characteristics most closely match the target sample according to YouGov's matching function. This constitutes the analytic CES sample. \\[8pt]
\textbf{Weighted Matched Sample} & The matched sample after post-survey weighting (propensity weighting or entropy balancing), intended to reduce remaining imbalance between the matched and target samples. \\
