This project requires 3 interlocking sources of data
I. CES
II. CPS 
III. Election returns

I. CES
The CES data should be downloaded from the CES Dataverse. Links to each year's release can be found under "Download CES Datasets and Documentation" 
on this page: https://tischcollege.tufts.edu/research-faculty/research-centers/cooperative-election-study/data-downloads-and-tools-scholars


II. The CPS data can be downloaded in 2 ways. 
(a) Manually from IPUMS by creating an "extract" here: https://cps.ipums.org/cps-action/variables/groupor. The user must select all the relevant monthly samples as well
as the necessary variables.
(b) Making an IPUMS account, getting an API key. 

I'd recommend option (b). Less manual work and cleaner.
